//joint_resources is an array of resources that are joined to this resource or this resource is joined to
//for example, households are joined to user_households
//alt: alternative terms for this resource that are acceptable
//joins: array of resources that this join resource is associating to this resource
//for example, related_suppliers is related to suppliers
//relationship: relationship type between resources
//m2m: many to many
//1:m: one to many
//m:1: many to one
